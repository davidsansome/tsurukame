**Contributing Guidelines**
--

The App Store release isn't updated as frequently as GitHub, since by the time a commit would be released, another commit would be ready for release. Therefore, we ask that you:
- Check the other issues (open and recently closed) to avoid duplicating issues
- Put issues here, not on the forums
- Ask questions about how to use the app on the forums, not here
- Be kind to other users (we are volunteers, not a company)
